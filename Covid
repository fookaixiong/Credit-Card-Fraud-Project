-- 1) Worldwide Covid Deaths

SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS worldwide_cases, SUM(new_deaths) AS worldwide_deaths, (SUM(new_deaths)/SUM(new_cases)*100) AS DeathPercent
FROM covid_data.covid_death
WHERE continent is not null
ORDER BY 1,2;

-- 2) Total deaths by continent
SELECT location, SUM(new_deaths) AS Total_death_count
FROM `covidproject-356511.covid_data.covid_death`
WHERE continent is null AND location not in("World","European Union","International","Upper middle income","High income","Lower middle income","Low income")
GROUP BY location

--3) MAX Percentage of Population infected by country (overall)
SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount, MAX(total_cases/population)*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM `covidproject-356511.covid_data.covid_death`
GROUP BY location, population

--4) MAX Percentage of Population infected by country overtime
SELECT location, date, population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount, MAX(total_cases/population)*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM `covidproject-356511.covid_data.covid_death`
GROUP BY location, population, date

-- xtra) Income vs vaccinations
SELECT location, population, sum(new_vaccinations) AS total_vaccinations,
(sum(new_vaccinations)/population*100) AS percent_vaccinated
FROM `covidproject-356511.covid_data.covid_vaccine`
WHERE location in ("High income","Upper middle income","Lower middle income", "Low income")
GROUP BY location, population;
-- From the result we see that high income the entire population gets vaccinated more than once, whereas low income have not completed 1 round
